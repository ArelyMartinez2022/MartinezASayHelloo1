THIS PROGRAM WILL ASK THE USER FOR THIER NAME
IT WILL PRRINT "GOOD MORNING" + THIER NAME 
AFTER IT WILL ASK THE USER IF THEY WANT TO PLAY AGAIN. IF THE USER TYPES IN ANY VARIATION OF "YES" THE PROGRAM WILL LOOP ONCE MORE AND VIS VERSA FOR "NO". HOWEVER IF THEY DONT TYPE EITHER OPTION IT WILL CONTINE TO ASK THE USER UNTILL THEY INPUT A VAILD OPTION

PEER REVIEW: Ulises Ortega
REVIEW: the program as described, you made a good use of the boolean and also converted the number, good job checking if the answer is emptry or, the play again feature works as expected with the yes or no
Good Job!
